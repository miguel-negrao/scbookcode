# Code examples for the SuperCollider book published by MIT

Thus repositiory replaces the old SuperCollider Book website. Thanks to madskjelldgaard for putting this together.

# Original README:

Welcome to The SuperCollider Book code repository!

You probably obtained this data from supercolliderbook.net

SuperCollider is under GNU GPL 3 and so is all the code here.

The folder allcodefigures contains all code based figures from the book, exactly as they appear in the book. The book code is originally built for compatibility with SC 3.4.

The other folders contain chapter by chapter breakdowns of code, which may include updates to cope with changes in SuperCollider or book errata. They also include extra files like compositions and classes, and bonus materials.

Almost all code is supplied as .scd (plain text, should work on all platforms easily) and .rtf (the Mac native format for SC files). In a few instances, authors may have chosen to use HTML or RTF specifically for some files. Conversion should be straight forward in those cases. Class files appearing as .sc are actually plain text, and you install classes following the instructions given in the book or in the main SuperCollider application help.

Have fun!
